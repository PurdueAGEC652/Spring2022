# Course Information

**Credit hours:** 3.0

**Instructional Modality:** Face-to-face (subject to change under university direction)


## Objectives

This course will introduce you to key computational methods used in applied economics research and prepare you to use these methods in your own research projects. By the end of the course, you should have an expanded tool set for applied research: you will understand why and when computational methods are needed in economics research, learn to identify and model economic problems that can be solved using such methods, and apply the appropriate method for each type of problem.

## Course summary

This course can be conceptually divided into four parts. In the first part, we will cover the fundamentals of scientific computing and best practices for research in economics. In the second part, we will study core computational methods including numerical linear algebra and calculus, rootfinding, and optimization. 

## Prerequisites

AGEC 552 or ECON 615. Alternatively, you should have a thorough understanding of matrix algebra and differential calculus, which are fundamental to this course. 

Some familiarity with computer programming is desirable but not strictly necessary. Please reach out to the instructor if you would like to discuss your background and possible supplemental materials.

## Readings

This course will be based on lecture notes provided by the instructor and select research papers. Course materials and references to research papers will be posted on the course website. The lecture notes will draw from and present a summarized version of select chapters from the three companion textbooks listed below. While there is no mandatory textbook for this course, it is highly recommended that you consult these references

1. Judd, Kenneth L. *Numerical Methods in Economics*. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998.
2. Miranda, Mario J. and Paul L. Fackler. *Applied Computational Economics and Finance*. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002.
