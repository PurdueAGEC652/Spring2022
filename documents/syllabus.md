# Course information

## Objectives and learning outcomes

This course will introduce you to key computational methods used in applied economics research and prepare you to use these methods in your own projects. By the end of the course, you should have an expanded toolset for applied research: you will understand why and when computational methods are needed in economics research, learn to identify and model economic problems that can be solved with such methods, and apply the appropriate method for each type of problem.

## Course summary

This course can be conceptually divided into three parts. In the first part, we will cover the fundamentals of scientific computing and best practices for research. In the second part, we will study and apply core computational methods, including numerical linear algebra and calculus, systems of equations, and constrained and unconstrained optimization. In the third and final part, we will cover how to take to data the models we learned to solve and introduce structural estimation of static models.

## Prerequisites

AGEC 552 or ECON 615. Alternatively, you should have a thorough understanding of matrix algebra and differential calculus, which are fundamental to this course. 

Familiarity with computer programming is desirable. In addition, some of the applications will require knowledge of basic game theory concepts such as Nash and subgame perfect equilibria. Please reach out to me if you would like to discuss your background and possible supplemental materials.


## Readings

This course will be based on lecture notes and select research papers. Course materials and references to research papers will be posted on the course website. 

The second part of the course will be closely related to select chapters from textbooks listed below. While there is no mandatory textbook for this course, I recommend that you consult these references for a deeper understanding of the methods we review in class with limited time.

- [MF02] Miranda, Mario J. and Paul L. Fackler. *Applied Computational Economics and Finance*. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002.
- [J98] Judd, Kenneth L. *Numerical Methods in Economics*. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998.
- [NW06] Nocedal, J. and S. J. Wright. *Numerical Optimization*. New York: Springer, 2nd edition, 2006.

Purdue Library offers online access to [MF02] and [NW06] and physical copies of [J98].


## Software 

Coding examples in this course will use [Julia language](https://julialang.org). Julia is a modern open-source programming language with excellent performance for numerical methods. It has an intuitive syntax and offers many packages to automate the methods we will learn and practice in this course. During the first part of the course, we will go over how to set up your coding environment for Julia.

Two good introductions to Julia are:

- Learning Julia [(https://julialang.org/learning)](https://julialang.org/learning)
- QuantEcon Julia lectures 1 to 5 [(https://julia.quantecon.org/intro.html)](https://julia.quantecon.org/intro.html).

## Hardware 

This course is designed to offer several opportunities for your to code and experiment with the methods we study. For this reason, it is desirable that you bring a laptop to class. Please let me know if you do not have access to a laptop for that purpose.

# Grading and assignments

## Grading 

- Six problem sets: 60% (10% each)
- Presentation of a computational paper: 10%
- Term paper (proposal, presentation, and final version submitted): 30%

## Important dates

- Term paper proposals due: March 11, 11:59 PM ET
- Term paper presentations: April 26 and 28
- Term paper due: May 6, 11:59 PM ET


## Assignments

### Problem sets

There will be six problem sets. Problem sets will be posted on the course website with submission instructions. These assignments will involve programming solutions to the problems presented and reporting results. Submissions must be individual, but you are highly encouraged to discuss your solutions with your classmates.

### Presentation of a computational paper

Starting from the first week in March, each student will make a 15-minute presentation to the class. The goal of these presentations is to illustrate applications or extensions of the methods we cover in the course. This could include an applied economic paper that uses computational methods, a paper that develops a computational method, or a tutorial-style presentation of a useful package. Detailed instructions and a list of suggested papers will be posted on the website later in the semester.

### Term paper

This is the final project for the course and an opportunity to put into practice the concepts covered in class. You may work individually or in a group of up to three people. There are two options for the term paper:

*A. A novel research project using computational methods*

A paper of this type must:

- Define an economic question and identify the contribution of the paper
- Formalize the question with a model or theoretical framework
- Describe how the model will be solved
- Present and discuss preliminary results

*B. Expand an existing paper with numerical methods*

A paper of this type must:

- Briefly summarize the existing paper
- Describe how you are extending the paper (e.g. a new method, an alternative functional form that does not have closed-form expression, a sensitivity analysis of parameters)
- Present and discuss preliminary results
- Compare the extended results with those in the original paper


A paper proposal of 1-2 pages is due March 11. This proposal should outline the items above (except for preliminary results).

Term papers must be submitted by May 6. The term paper should have a 12-point font, double spacing, 1-inch margins, and a maximum length of 15 pages (excluding tables, graphs, and appendices).

In particular, submissions of individual or group assignments must reflect exclusively the work of those listed in the submitted materials.

Any student found to have violated the course or university policies on assignments will receive a zero for that assignment. Multiple violations may result in failure of the course.


## Attendance 

This course follows Purdueâ€™s academic regulations regarding attendance, which states that students are expected to be present for every meeting of the classes in which they are enrolled. However, we are living through uncertain times, and health or family-related issues might lead you to miss classes. If you must miss a class at any point in time during the semester -- be it for University-sponsored activities, religious observations, or personal/health reasons -- please reach out to me as soon as possible via Purdue email so that we can communicate about how you can maintain your academic progress. I will analyze and make accommodations on a case-by-case basis. If you find yourself too sick to progress in the course, notify your adviser (or program coordinator) and notify me via email or Brightspace. We will make arrangements based on your particular situation.

If you are unable to make direct contact with me and are unable to leave word with the department because of circumstances beyond your control, and in cases falling under excused absence regulations, you or your representative should contact or go to the [Office of the Dean of Students website](https://www.purdue.edu/advocacy/students/absences.htmlhttps://www.purdue.edu/advocacy/students/absences.html) to complete appropriate forms for instructor notification.

Under academic regulations, excused absences may be granted for cases of grief/bereavement, military service, jury duty, and parenting leave.
